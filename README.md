# Epicycloid Project

This repository contains the code for a website that showcases various examples of epicycloids. The website is built using Next.js, a powerful React framework, and utilizes TypeScript for rendering animations in a canvas with GPU acceleration for smooth visuals.

## Features
- **Dynamic and interactive experience**: The website provides a dynamic and interactive experience for users to explore the different types of epicycloids.
- **Fully rendered animations**: The animations are not static images but fully rendered with TypeScript in a canvas, utilizing GPU acceleration for smooth visuals.

## Weaknesses
- **Desktop-only**: The website is not mobile-friendly and will only work on a desktop, as it is not designed to be viewed on a smartphone.
- **Language**: The website is only available in Italian. It may be rewritten in English in the future.

## Usage
To use this website, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Once you have cloned the repository, you can run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and allow you to view the website in your browser.

## Demo
